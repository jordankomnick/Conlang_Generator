# Conlang_Generator
Creates words for your conlang (constructed language) based on a given set of syllable rules

Learn about conlangs here: http://www.zompist.com/kit.html

How to use:
1. Add initials, medials, and finals with the provided input boxes
  a. An initial is the first sound in a syllable, can be a consonant, a group of consonants, or blank
  b. A medial is the middle sound in a syllable, usually a vowel sound
  c. A final is the ending sound in a syllable, can be a consonant, a group of consonants, or blank
  NOTE: There is an error when attempting to add blanks to the generator
  NOTE: The same sounds can be added multiple times in the same category, try adding more common sounds in your language multiple times to increase their frequency in generated words

2. Set number of words to generate (1-100) and min and max syllables per word (1-5)

3. Click "Generate" to get words for your language

4. If you want more words, keep clicking "Generate"

5. Create grammar, syntax, and a writing system for your new language!
