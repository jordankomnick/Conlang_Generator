How to use:

1. Add initials, medials, and finals with the provided input boxes

  c. A final is the ending sound in a syllable, can be a consonant, a group of consonants, or blank

2. Set the frequency of each initial, medial, and final from 1-99. Sounds with a frequency of 5 will appear 5 times as often as sounds with a frequency of 1.

3. Set number of words to generate (1-100) and min and max syllables per word (1-5)
