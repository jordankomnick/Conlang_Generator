# Conlang_Generator
Creates words for your conlang (constructed language) based on a given set of syllable rules

Learn about conlangs here: http://www.zompist.com/kit.html

How to use:
1. Add initials, medials, and finals with the provided input boxes
  a. An initial is the first sound in a syllable, can be a consonant, a group of consonants, or blank
  b. A medial is the middle sound in a syllable, usually a vowel sound
  c. A final is the ending sound in a syllable, can be a consonant, a group of consonants, or blank
  NOTE: To add a "blank" option to the generator, simply click the "Add" button without typing anything into the box
  NOTE: The same sounds can be added multiple times in the same category, try adding more common sounds in your language multiple times to increase their frequency in generated words
